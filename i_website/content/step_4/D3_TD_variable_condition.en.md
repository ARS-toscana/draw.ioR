description: "contains the time-dependent evolution of the binary variable condition. Only changes of status are recorded, with date when the condition changes; the components of the condition last 365 days if they are diagnosis, and 90 days if they are drug proxies; unique spells are created when the algorithm is 1 (if either a dianosis or a drug proxy is active), and the algorithm is reverted to values 0 whenever no component is active"
